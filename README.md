# Python Assignment Solutions

This repository contains solutions to six simple Python programming assignments. Each program is designed to solve basic problems using conditional statements, loops, and functions.

## Assignment Questions

1. **Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero**
   - This program accepts an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
   
2. **Check if a Number is Odd or Even**
   - This program determines whether an integer is odd or even based on the remainder when divided by 2.
   
3. **Check Leap Year**
   - A program that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not, following the leap year rules (divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400).
   
4. **Check Prime Number**
   - This program checks if a given number is prime by verifying that it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
   
5. **Print all Prime Numbers in an Interval of 1-10000**
   - This program prints all prime numbers in the range of 1 to 10000 using a loop and prime-checking logic.
